Sorry but I think I did a beautiful job on the diagram. I have never been proud of a diagram in any of my previous college courses. But this one I love.

This diagram shows my entire cloud setup, including the jumpbox and the Docker containers running on each virtual machine (VM).

Azure resources group: RedTeam

Virtual network with IP address range

Subnet range

Flow of traffic:
SSH: 22
HTTP: 80

Security group blocking traffic

Load Balancer

All 4 VMs

And where Docker, and Ansible are deployed.
